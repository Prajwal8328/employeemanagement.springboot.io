# Employee Management API

## Introduction
Hy i am prajwal kumar swain.
Welcome to the Employee Management API project! This project demonstrates the creation of a RESTful API for managing employee data using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Spring Boot or an experienced developer seeking a reference project, you'll find valuable insights here.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [MySQL Database](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional, for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-api.git

Navigate to the project directory:
 cd employee-management-api
 
Configure MySQL Database:

    Create a MySQL database schema named employeerepo.
    Update the database connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties if necessary.
    
Build and run the application:
    mvn spring-boot:run
The API should now be running at http://localhost:8081/api/employees. You can access it using tools like Postman or a web browser.
Usage

The API supports the following operations:

    Create Employee: POST /api/employees
    Retrieve All Employees: GET /api/employees
    Retrieve Employee by ID: GET /api/employees/{id}
    Update Employee: PUT /api/employees/{id}
    Delete Employee: DELETE /api/employees/{id}

API Documentation (Upcoming)

I am actively working on implementing API documentation using Swagger to provide detailed information about our API endpoints. Swagger will make it easier for you to explore and interact with our API.

Once the Swagger documentation is available, you'll be able to access it at http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html while the application is running.
I am committed to improving your experience with our API, and this documentation will be a valuable resource.

In the meantime, if you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to contact us.

      git push origin feature/your-feature-name

Create a Pull Request (PR): Go to the main page of the original repository. GitHub should detect your recently pushed branch and offer to create a pull request. Provide a clear and concise title and description for your PR, explaining what it does.

Review and Discuss: Be prepared for feedback and discussions on your pull request. Project maintainers and other contributors may review your code and suggest changes or improvements.

Continuous Integration: Ensure that your code passes any automated tests or checks set up for the project. If there are issues, address them in your branch.

Merge and Close: Once your pull request is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the main branch. Congratulations, you've made a contribution!
